# Color Name Prediction

**Color Name Prediction** is a web application that predicts the name of a color when a user clicks on an image. It uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find the nearest color name based on the RGB value. The dataset contains a diverse set of approximately 865 color names.
